/**
 * Questions library
 *
 * Use this file to create your own set of questions.
 *
 * Object properties:
 *      index:          The index of the question in this list
 *      question:       The question you want Alexa to ask
 *      answers:        The list of available answers
 *      correct_answer: The correct answer to the question
 *
 * When adding or updating questions and answers, you must take the list of all values
 * in each of the 'answers' arrays for all questions and add them to a custom slot
 * in your skill called 'answers'.
 *
 * The 'answers' custom slot is be mapped to a couple of intents in the interaction model.
 * One intent, named 'AnswerOnlyIntent', contains only the slot, by itself, in order
 * to maximize the accuracy of the model.
 *
 * For example:
 *      AnswerOnlyIntent {answers}
 *
 * The other intent, 'AnswerQuestionIntent', provides more complex speech patterns
 * to match other utternaces users may include with their answers.
 *
 * For example:
 *      AnswerQuestionIntent is it {answers}
 *      AnswerQuestionIntent it is {answers}
 *      AnswerQuestionIntent the answer is {answers}
 *      AnswerQuestionIntent I think the answer is {answers}
 *
 * See model file at models/en-US.json for a complete example.
